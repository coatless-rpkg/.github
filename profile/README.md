# Various R Packages

Welcome to [@coatless](https://github.com/coatless) and contributors' collection of R packages! 
This GitHub organization serves as a central repository for R packages that provide statistical computing tools, data analysis utilities, and enhanced R programming capabilities.

Each R package is maintained in its own repository, making it easy to find, use, and contribute to specific projects.

## Installation

Most packages can be installed from either CRAN (Stable) or GitHub (Developmental).

For CRAN released packages, you can install them using: 

```r
install.packages("package_name")
```

For developmental and cutting-edge features, please install the package using:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("coatless-rpkg/package_name")
```

## Requirements

We assume at least the following is available:

- R (>= 4.2.0)
- RStudio (recommended), Positron, or VS Code
- Additional dependencies specified in individual repository DESCRIPTION files

## Contact

For questions, suggestions, or issues:

- Open an issue in the relevant repository
- Contact [@coatless](https://github.com/coatless) directly through [social media](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/)

## Acknowledgments

We thank all contributors who have helped improve and maintain these packages. Special thanks to the R community for their continued support and inspiration.
